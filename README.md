# ponykorn 60
 O-ring mount 60% pcb. This PCB was was design and replicated from the orignial Bakeneko60. It taught me how to design my own PCB so thank you Katano! Sept-Oct, 2020.
 
 # Q&A.
  Is it usable?
  To be honest I do not know haha, I have yet to have one printed and tested for over a year now but hopefully it works.
  Would this work with the current bakeneko?
  In theory I would assume so, but again I have yet to try it out for myself to give the final conclusion.
  Would you ever run GB for this?
  No haha this PCB was only used for educational purposes for myself if you would like to support the original creator 
  (@kkatano)I would highly suggest you do so.
